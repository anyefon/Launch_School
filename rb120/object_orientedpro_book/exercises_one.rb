An object is created by first defining a class(the blueprint for an object), and instantiating
an object by invoking the new method on the class. 

A module is a collection of reusable code for classes. It serves to prevent 
repetition of method definitions across classes. With modules, a method is defined
once, and the module can be mixed into any class that requires the method(behaviour)
